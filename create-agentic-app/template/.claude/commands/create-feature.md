# Given the above conversation:

- Store the requirements and implementation plan in /specs. Create a new sub folder for this feature. The implementation plan should be split into phases with actionable tasks for each phase. Each tasks should have a checkbox so we can keep track of our progress - example [ ] Task description.

- Exclude unit and e2e testing from the implementation plan, UNLESS the user clearly asks for it to be included.

- IF no conversation exists and the implementation plan is not clear, then ask the user what the requirements are first and then create the spec sub-folder, requirements and implementation plan .md files.
